So I have a blog/web page for connectstats and other app already, aimed at users, I have a twitter page, a facebook page and a github page. So why a new web site?

Well, this is really about learning jekyll and figuring out how to use github pages. Why? Well, my son was thinking about building a web site for a portfolio of his development activities, he is active on github so I advised him to try building it on github pages. Of course I have to drink my own coolaid and figure out how to use it too...
