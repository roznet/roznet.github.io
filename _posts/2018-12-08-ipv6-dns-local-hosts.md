One of the challenges of my network setup was to ensure that I could access the different services I am running on different services via hostname. For that I needed to make sure that the DNS forwarded on my Unifi USG Gateway was properly setup and with the list of host names. These involved several steps to get everything right

## Getting the list of hosts and IP in the gateway

The first thing was to get the list of hostname and ip to be known by the Unifi Gateway

One issue that has been bugging me for a while was that on iPhone or other devices I was unable to access devices on my local network by their host names.
