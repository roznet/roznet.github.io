title: "Uploading to a Unifi Controller the list of aliases for hosts"

I have always maintained the list of mac addresses, assigned IPs and device aliases so that I can quickly identify devices in various network utilities I use. 

The unifi controller is a great way to display a lot of information about what is happening on the network, but I wanted to find a way to synchronize of bulk upload all the aliases without entering everything manually again.

Luckily, the unifi controller has a great api, which made this possible.
